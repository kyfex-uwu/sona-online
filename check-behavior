what does gremlin kitten/kibby otes/dark cat wizard override? (they all say "scare", not "scare attempt" or "remove")
  * im assuming nothing BUT just to make sure

- little boss (instead of sending to runaway, keep on deck) (pretty sure nothing overrides this)
- noble rat (you may change the scare target to this card instead)

do gremlin kitten/kibby otes/dcw abilities consume a scare?
